## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
The main goal of this project’s UI/UX design is to create a **seamless and intuitive booking experience** for users. The design will prioritize **clarity, responsiveness, and simplicity** while ensuring that users can easily navigate, browse properties, and complete bookings without confusion.  

Key objectives include:
- Providing a **clean and minimal interface** that emphasizes property images and details.  
- Ensuring **easy navigation** across all primary pages.  
- Supporting a **responsive layout** for both desktop and mobile devices.  
- Offering a **smooth checkout flow** with minimal steps.  

### Key Features
- **Search and filter options** to allow users to quickly find properties.  
- **Property cards** displaying essential details (price, location, rating, and thumbnail).  
- **Detailed property view** with descriptions, amenities, availability, and booking options.  
- **Simple checkout flow** to confirm reservations with minimal friction.  

### Primary Pages Overview

| Page                     | Description |
|--------------------------|-------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a list/grid of available properties with images, price, location, and ratings. Users can apply filters and sorting to refine their search. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows detailed information about a selected property, including full-size images, amenities, host details, availability calendar, and a "Book Now" option. |
| **Simple Checkout View** | Provides a streamlined process to confirm booking details, select payment method, and complete the reservation in just a few steps. |

### Importance of a User-Friendly Design
In a booking system like this, **user experience directly affects trust and conversion rates**. A confusing or cluttered interface can discourage users from completing bookings. A user-friendly design ensures:  
- **Ease of navigation** so users quickly find what they need.

## Feature Breakdown

The Airbnb Clone project is built around core features that replicate real-world functionality of Airbnb. Each feature ensures a smooth user experience for both guests and hosts.

### 1. User Management
Users can sign up, log in, and manage their profiles. This feature ensures authentication, authorization, and role management (guests, hosts, and admins) to provide secure access across the platform.

### 2. Property Management
Hosts can list their properties by adding details such as title, description, location, photos, and price per night. This feature enables property owners to showcase their listings and make them available for bookings.

### 3. Booking System
Guests can view property availability and make reservations for their preferred dates. The booking system manages conflicts, validates availability, and ensures that reservations are linked to both the user and the property.

### 4. Review System
Guests can leave reviews and ratings for properties they have stayed in. This feature helps future guests make informed decisions while encouraging hosts to maintain high-quality listings.

### 5. Payment Integration
The platform supports secure payment processing for confirmed bookings. This ensures a smooth financial transaction between guests and hosts, with statuses such as pending, completed, or failed.

### 6. Search and Filtering
Guests can search for properties using filters such as location, price range, availability, and ratings. This feature makes it easier to find suitable listings quickly and efficiently.

### 7. Admin Dashboard
Admins have tools to monitor platform activity, manage users, handle reported properties, and ensure compliance with platform policies. This feature maintains the integrity and security of the platform.




## API Security

Securing the backend APIs is critical to ensure user trust, protect sensitive information, and maintain the integrity of the platform. The following security measures will be implemented in the project:

### 1. Authentication
Only registered users should be able to access protected resources. Authentication (e.g., JWT tokens or OAuth) ensures that each request is tied to a verified identity.  
**Why it matters:** Protects user accounts and prevents unauthorized access to the system.

### 2. Authorization
Different users (guests, hosts, admins) have different permissions. Authorization ensures that users can only perform actions they are allowed to, such as a host editing their own property but not another host’s.  
**Why it matters:** Prevents privilege misuse and enforces role-based access control.

### 3. Data Encryption
Sensitive data such as passwords and payment details will be encrypted both in transit (using HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (using hashing and encryption techniques).  
**Why it matters:** Protects confidential information from being intercepted or exposed.

### 4. Rate Limiting & Throttling
APIs will implement rate limiting to prevent abuse, brute force attacks, or denial-of-service attempts.  
**Why it matters:** Ensures system stability and prevents malicious overloads.

### 5. Input Validation & Sanitization
All incoming requests will be validated and sanitized to protect against SQL injection, XSS, and other injection attacks.  
**Why it matters:** Maintains data integrity and prevents attackers from manipulating the database or application logic.

### 6. Secure Payments
Integration with trusted third-party payment gateways will be protected with strong encryption and verification methods.  
**Why it matters:** Ensures the safety of financial transactions between guests and hosts.

### 7. Logging & Monitoring
API requests will be logged and monitored for suspicious activity. Al
